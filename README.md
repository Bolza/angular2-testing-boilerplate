# Angular2 Testing Boilerplater
## Uses Webpack2 and Karma
### Started from https://github.com/preboot/angular2-webpack

The idea is that you can drop your custom component into 
this boilerplate and run your tests completely isolated from 
the any other feature/hassle.

Ideally i'll also add a clrea flow to publish the package on npm.
